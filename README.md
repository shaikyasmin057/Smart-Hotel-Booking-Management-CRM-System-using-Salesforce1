## 4. Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis  

- **Perishable Inventory:** Hotel rooms are perishable‚Äîunsold rooms = lost revenue. Hence, dynamic pricing and channel management are essential.  
- **Guest Experience Focus:** Beyond transactions, hotels must build relationships through personalized services, loyalty rewards, and seamless digital communication.  
- **Complex Asset Management:** Unlike retail, hotels manage multiple room types, group bookings, event spaces, restaurants, spas, etc., requiring integrated CRM + PMS (Property Management System).  
- **Competition Pressure:** Hotels must compete with OTAs (Booking.com, Expedia) and alternatives (Airbnb), highlighting the need for direct booking systems with better customer experience.
